200053144	GSE53144	Male and Female DNA and RNA sequencing in several nematode species	"The overall goal of this investigation was to investigate X-content of sex-biased genes in several nematode species. The following species of nematode were investigated: *C. elegans, *N2; *C. brenneri, *PB2801; *C. briggsae, *AF16; *C. remanei*, PB4641; *P. **pacificus, *PS312*.* Genomic DNA sequencing data was used to assign X and autosomal - linkage to unassembled sequencing contigs. Male and female RNA seq data was then generated and used to determine sex-biased expression. For both DNA and RNA experiments, 50bp paired-end (DNA) or single-end (RNA) reads were generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Sequencing lanes were multiplexed. Genomic DNA was isolated from 50-100 hand-picked young adult worms. At least two replicates for each sex were prepared. DNA was sheared via sonication and 350-500 bp sequencing libraries were prepared following the Illumina protocol. Total RNA was isolated from at least 1000 hand-picked L4/young adult worms (*C. **elegans, *N2) or J4/young adult worms (*P. pacificus, *PS312*). *PolyA beads were used to enrich for mRNA. Stranded RNAseq libraries were prepared via incorporation of dUTPs during cDNA synthesis, following the protocol detailed in Parkhomchuk et al, 2009. DNAseq and RNAseq reads were aligned to the appropriate WS228 reference genomes."	"SRR1056315, SRR1056317, SRR1056319, SRR1056321"	"SRR1056307, SRR1056309, SRR1056311, SRR1056314"	SINGLE	51	
200083216	GSE83216	Developmental transcriptomes of the two sexes in Caenorhabditis elegans during sexual maturation	"We compare whole-animal RNA-seq transcriptomes for C. elegans males and hermaphrodites from the late L3 larval stage to young adulthood. During this interval, male sexual structures develop, including extensive neurogenesis and synaptogenesis that nearly doubles the size of the nervous system. Previous genome-wide expression studies in C. elegans have usually focused on only one sex Ð the hermaphrodite, and there are a relatively large number of predicted genes that still remain without meaningful annotation. In the present study, differential expression analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed 1,751 genes expressed at a higher level in the male. By differential expression analysis, unbiased gene correlation analysis, and a guilt-by-association approach, we identified new transcription factors required for differentiation of male genital structures, semen proteins, and candidates for previously-unknown components for synapse function. The results validate the dataset as a rich resource for future gene discovery in C. elegans."

200222447	GSE222447	RNA-seq analysis of young adult daf-18(ok480) and control worms	"RNA-seq analysis was used to identify the gene expression changes in male and hermaphroditie when daf-18 is lost. Based on these sequencing data, the genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated by at least 2 times (|log2 (folding change) | ³ 1 and padj ² 0.05) were analyzed. The analysis of these differentially expressed genes' pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment shows that the influence of different genders after daf-18 deletion is enriched to some signal pathways, including longevity and protein degradation pathway in endoplasmic reticulum, etc."	"SRR23024200, SRR23024201, SRR23024202"	"SRR23024194, SRR23024195, SRR23024196"	PAIRED	300	controls. all animals him-5(e1490)
200041367	GSE41367	Caenorhabditis sex-specific RNAseq	"This project defines the transcriptomes of XO (male) and XX (female or mutant pseudo-female) Caenorhabditis nematodes. The data allow the overall composition and sexual regulation of the transcriptome within a single species to be determined. In addition, the five related species studied allow meta-comparisons between them. Because two of the five (C. elegans and C. briggsae) produce a self-fertile XX hermaphrodite, while the XX sex in the remaining three (C. japonica, C. remanei, and C. brenneri) are true females, the data are particularly useful for inferring effects of sexual mode on genome-wide gene expression."
