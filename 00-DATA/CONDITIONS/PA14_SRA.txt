Reveal the host’s broad transcriptional response to P. aeruginosa infection during disruption of the intestinal barrier. We used RNA-Seq analysis to study the transcriptomic profiles of wt worms were exposed to either P. aeruginosa PA14 or E. coli OP50 for 24 hours, and the transcriptomic profiles of egl-44(MT2247) mutants fed E. coli OP50 for 24 hours. Differential expression analysis was performed by comparing wt worms exposed to PA14 versus wt worms exposed to E. coli OP50, and egl-44(MT2247) mutants fed E. coli OP50 versus WT worms fed E. coli OP50."

200202258	GSE202258	Bacterial pattern recognition in C. elegans by the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-86/HNF4	"Pattern recognition of bacterial products by host receptors is essential for pathogen sensing in many metazoans. Caenorhabditis elegans, however, do not utilize canonical pattern recognition receptors to activate innate immunity toward bacterial pathogens. Whether other mechanisms evolved in nematodes to directly sense pathogens is not known. Here, we characterize the first bacterial pattern recognition receptor and its natural ligand in C. elegans. We show that the C. elegans nuclear hormone receptor NHR-86/HNF4 senses phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN), a metabolite produced by pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to activate protective anti-pathogen defenses in the intestine. PCN binds to the ligand binding domain of NHR-86/HNF4, a ligand-gated transcription factor, which engages a transcriptional program in intestinal epithelial cells that promotes metabolism of toxic phenazines to provide protection against P. aeruginosa. These data de-orphan a nuclear hormone receptor and demonstrate that sensing a metabolite signal of bacterial virulence allows nematodes to detect pathogens in its environment that are poised to cause disease."

200121508	GSE121508	Comparison of Pseudomonas responsive gene expression after histone methyltransferase RNAi in C. elegans	"We resport the changes in gene expression occuring after Pseudomonas exposure in C. elegans with low s-adenosylmethionine, or RNAi of two H3K4 methyltransferases Using a C. elegans model of low SAM, we previously found that transcriptional responses response to a bacterial pathogen failed and these bacterial-response genes did not show normal H3K4me3 close to the transcriptional start sites, (Ding et al. 2015 Cell Metabolism). We also found the HMT set-16/MLL was required for full induction, whereas set-2/SET1 appeared dispensable (Ding et al. 2015 Cell Metabolism). We hypothesized that animals with low SAM might fail to transcriptionally respond to stress and that the HMTs may also have distinct roles in modulating stress responses. In our present study, we set out to compare induction of transcriptional responses and survival upon stress exposure between C. elegans with reduced SAM (sams-1(RNAi)) and animals with limited H3K4me3 function, set-2/SET1, and set-16/MLL RNAi. Because distinct stresses may rely on different transcriptional activation mechanisms, we also compared whole-genome expression patterns in three stresses: pathogenic bacteria (PA14), xenotoxic (R24) and heat in response to each RNAi."

We found that NPR-8 suppresses the expression of genes related to cuticle structure activity including collagen genes, and lack of NPR-8-mediated suppression in npr-8(ok1439) animals contributes to their improved survival against P. aeruginosa infection."

200134687	GSE134687	Oligosaccharyl transferase that maintains ER homeostasis enhances immunity via up-regulating p38 MAP kinase signaling in C. elegans	"Oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) protein complex mediates the N-linked glycosylation of substrate proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which regulates stability, activity and localization of its substrates. Although many OST substrate proteins have been identified, the physiological role of OST complex remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that OST complex in C. elegans is crucial for ER protein homeostasis and enhances resistance to pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14), via immune-regulatory PMK-1/p38 MAP kinase."

We found that UNC-49 suppresses the expression of insulin pathway genes, and lack of UNC-49-mediated suppression in unc-49(e407) animals contributes to their improved survival against P. aeruginosa infection."

We found that a bZIP transcription factor ZIP-11 is dramatically induced in wild-type worm upon PA14 infection. And ZIP-11 promotes innate immunity through activating PMK-1/p38 pathway and interacting with a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein CEBP-2."

200178572	GSE178572	Sterol scarcity primes p38 immune defenses through a TIR-1/SARM1 phase transition	"Intracellular signaling regulators are concentrated into membrane-free, higher-ordered protein assemblies to initiate protective responses during stress — a process known as phase transition. Here, we show that a phase transition of the C. elegans Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain protein (TIR-1), a homolog of the mammalian sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1), primes host immune defenses when dietary sterols are limited to handle subsequent bacterial infection. TIR-1/SARM1 is an upstream component of the p38 PMK-1 pathway in intestinal cells, an innate immune defense and stress response pathway in metazoans. Under conditions of low cholesterol availability, multimerization and precipitation of TIR-1/SARM1 potentiates the intrinsic NAD+ glycohydrolase activity of this protein complex, increases p38 PMK-1 phosphorylation, and promotes pathogen clearance from the intestine. Dietary cholesterol is required for C. elegans to survive infection with pathogenic bacteria and to support development, fecundity, and lifespan. Thus, activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway in sterol-deficient animals is an adaptive response that allows a metazoan host to anticipate environmental threats under conditions of essential metabolite scarcity."

Methods: Synchronized L1 worms were placed onto NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 and grown at 20 °C until the L4 stage. Worms were washed off the plates, collected with M9 solution and subsequently transferred to modified NGM plates containing E. coli OP50 or P. aeruginosa PA14 for 24 h at 25 °C. Then, the animals were washed off the plates with M9 solution and frozen in TRIzol (Transgen, ER501-01, China) with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using a TransZol Up Plus RNA kit (Transgen, ER501-01, China). Results: RNA seq analyses shows enriched and signficant changed immune genes, neuropeptides, transcription factors and pathways that are dependent of GABA signaling. Conclusion: Our studies uncover that GABA signaling enhance the resistence to pathogen induced killing."
