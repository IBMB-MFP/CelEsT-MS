200081520	GSE81520	RNA-seq analysis in C. elegans larval development and heat shock	"To understand the function and regulation of the C. elegans heat shock factor (HSF-1) in larval development, we have used ChIP-seq to analyze the occupancy of HSF1 and RNA Pol II in L2 larvae and young adult (YA) animals grown at 20¡C or upon heat shock at 34¡C for 30 min. In addition, we have used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of wild type (N2), hsf-1(ok600) mutants and hsf-1(ok600); rmSi1[hsf-1::gfp] L2 larvae grown at 20¡C and characterized the gene expression change by heat shock in wild type (N2), hsf-1(sy441) and hsf-1(sy441);rmSi1[hsf-1::gfp] animals at L2 stage."

200162064	GSE162064	Using Auxin-inducible-degradation System to Interrogate Tissue-specific Transcriptional Programs of HSF-1 in Reproduction and Heat Shock Response. [HS response]	"To understand the roles of HSF-1 and its regulation in reproduction and heat shock response in a tissue-specific manner, we coupled tissue-specific HSF-1 depletion in C. elegans by auxin-inducible degron (AID) with genome-wide transcriptional analyses in whole animals. We used ChIP-seq to analyze the occupancy of HSF-1 (tagged with AID::GFP) and RNA Pol II in young adult (YA) animals grown at 20¡C or upon heat shock (HS) at 34¡C for 30 min following an acute depletion of HSF-1 by AID for 2 hours either in the somatic or in the germline cells. Depletion by AID was performed by transferring worms expressing the E3 ligase TIR1 and carrying AID insertion to endogenous HSF-1 (JTL611 or JTL621) to NGM plates containing 1mM auxin (indole- 3-acetic acid, Sigma). The mock treatment was done by transferring worms to plates only containing the vehicle ethanol (EtOH). In parallel, we used RNA-seq to analyze the heat shock respnse upon depletion of HSF-1 in the soma or the germline for 2 hours. In addition, we also analyzed the transcriptomic changes by RNA-seq upon tissue-specific depletion of HSF-1 initiated at young adult stage for different length of time. In all RNA-seq analyses, we included the strains that only express TIR1 but do not have degron insertion at HSF-1 (CA1200 and CA1199) to control for the effects of auxin treatment and AID insertion into HSF-1."

200122015	GSE122015	A-to-I RNA editing affects lncRNAs expression after heat shock	"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a highly conserved regulatory process carried out by adenosine deaminases (ADARs) on dsRNAs. Although a significant fraction of the transcriptome is edited, the function of most editing sites is unknown. Previous studies indicated changes in A-to-I RNA editing frequencies following exposure to several stress types. However, the overall effect of stress on the expression of ADAR targets is not fully understood. Here we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of wildtype and ADAR mutant C. elegans worms after heat shock, to analyze the effect of heat shock stress on the expression pattern of genes. We found that ADAR regulation following heat shock does not involve directly heat shock related genes. Our analysis also revealed that, lncRNAs and pseudogenes, which have a tendency for secondary RNA structures, are enriched among upregulated genes upon heat shock in ADAR mutant worms, while they are downregulated in ADAR mutant worms under permissive conditions. Therefore, temperature increases may destabilize dsRNA structures and protect them from RNAi degradation, despite the lack of ADAR function. These findings shade a new light on the dynamics of gene expression under heat shock in relation to ADAR function."

200151164	GSE151164	Caenorhabditis elegans AF4/FMR2 family homolog affl-2 regulates heat shock induced gene expression	"To mitigate the deleterious effects of temperature increases on cellular organization and proteotoxicity, organisms have developed mechanisms to respond to heat stress. In eukaryotes, HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat shock transcriptional response, but the heat shock response pathway is not yet fully understood. From a forward genetic screen for suppressors of heat shock induced gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found a new allele of hsf-1 that alters its DNA-binding domain, and we found three additional alleles of sup-45, a previously molecularly uncharacterized genetic locus. We identified sup-45 as one of the two hitherto unknown C. elegans orthologs of the human AF4/FMR2 family proteins, which are involved in regulation of transcriptional elongation rate. We thus renamed sup-45 as affl-2 (AF4/FMR2-Like). Through RNA-seq, we demonstrated that affl-2 mutants are deficient in heat shock induced transcription. Additionally, affl-2 mutants have herniated intestines, while worms lacking its sole paralog (affl-1) appear wild type. AFFL-2 is a broadly expressed nuclear protein, and nuclear localization of AFFL-2 is necessary for its role in heat shock response. affl-2 and its paralog are not essential for proper HSF-1 expression and localization after heat shock, which suggests that affl-2 may function downstream or parallel of hsf-1. Our characterization of affl-2 provides insights into the regulation of heat shock induced gene expression to protect against heat stress."			SINGLE	50	complicatedrunsstructure

200223596	GSE223596	"S-adenosylmethionine synthases specify distinct H3K3me3 populations and gene expression patterns during heat stress [RNA-seq: sams-4 RNAi, Heat shock]"	"We find that two SAM synthases in C. elegans, SAMS-1 and SAMS-3/4, contribute differently to modification of H3K4me3, gene expression and survival in the heat stress response. Our data showing differential SAM provisioning to distinct groups of methylated targets based on SAM synthase source suggests that determining how methyl donors are provided will broaden insight into 1CC functions in aging and stress."
