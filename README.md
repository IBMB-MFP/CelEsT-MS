# CelEsT
This repository contains the code for the manuscript - CelEsT: a unified gene regulatory network for estimating transcription factor activities in C. elegans. Perez 2024

The folders are numbered in order of execution, as are the scripts within each folder. This is important as each script may relay on outputs from previous scripts in order to function.

I have done my best to ensure the code runs smooothly but as in the course of manuscript preparation the code was run interactively there may be some bugs when attempting to run the entire code as is - I apologise in advance.

Any questions please raise an issue on this page.

Note several analyses with CelEsT are available via the CelEsT R Shiny app found at [github.com/IBMB-MFP/CelEsT-app].

Thanks for your interest in CelEsT!
